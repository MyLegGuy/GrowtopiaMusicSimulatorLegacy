This software works fine, but it won't be updated any more. You may want to use [Growtopia Music Simulator Final](https://github.com/MyLegGuy/GrowtopiaMusicSimulatorFinal).

To use audio gears, place one down and then click on it with audio gear selected.

To ask for help, PM MyLegGuy on [the Growtopia forums](https://growtopiagame.com/forums/) or create a [Github issue](https://github.com/MyLegGuy/GrowtopiaMusicSimulatorRe-born/issues).
