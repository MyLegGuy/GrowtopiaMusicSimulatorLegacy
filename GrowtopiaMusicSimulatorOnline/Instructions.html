<h4>Page Explanation</h4><hr />
<p>A Growtopia world is 100 blocks wide. You can have four rows of music in one world. 100*4 is 400. So Growtopia Music Simulator needs to let you place notes in that big of an area. However, it would be stupid if the entire world was shown at once. That's where pages come in.</p>
<p>You can see 25 blocks at once. If you advance to the next page, you see the next 25 blocks. There's a total of 16 pages, giving you the complete 400 blocks of space to work with. The song plays from page 1 to 16, of course.</p>

<h4>Options</h4>
<hr />
On the <a href="./Options.html">options page</a>, there are a few settings you can change. You can make it so you hear the sound of a note when you place it, turn on minimal settings to gain a very little speed, and change the background (theme). Don't forget to click the save button.<br />When changing the theme, you must enter a direct url to an image. That means linking to <a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/jHkKY">something like this</a> wouldn't be okay, but <a href="http://i.imgur.com/CePGQqw.png">this would</a>.
